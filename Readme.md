# Guess the Number Game



#### A simple Python project where the computer generates a random number, and the player has to guess it. The program provides hints whether the guess is too high or too low until the player guesses the correct number.

## Features
* Computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
* User is prompted to input guesses.
* Feedback is given whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
* Keeps track of the number of attempts made by the player.
* The game ends once the player guesses the correct number.
